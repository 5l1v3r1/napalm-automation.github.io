## Intro

It's been a year since our last hackathon so it's time for a second take. This year, in addition to giving you a NAPALM update and present a couple of new projects, we will also have a few talks from various other projects leveraging on napalm and a talk from Gabriele Gerbino who was the unofficial winner for the non-existent contest we had in the hackathon we held last year :)

## Code of Conduct

Be nice, respectful and have fun!

## Prize

So last year we didn't really organized any contest as we didn't have prizes and we didn't really thought about it. However, this year we have a prize :)

### Who?

We (Kirk, Mircea and David) will probably decide ourselves but we will let the community influence our decision so make sure you make it clear ;)

### When?

We will deliberate during Monday and Tuesday and probably write an announcement during the week.

### What?

[Andrew Dampf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-dampf-1237a418/) on behalf of [Linode](https://www.linode.com) is donating a year of service for the winner :)
