Just a quick announcement. As [previously](/reunification-beta-announcement) discussed we have been working in the past few weeks in reunifying all the drivers into a single repo. We are happy to announce the first official release has just been pushed to pip. This new version, tagged 2.0.0, should work exactly like the latest individual release for each driver.

There are a few administrative things to deal with but other than that this version should be ready for mass consumption. The only disclaimer to add is that the community drivers (FortiOS, Pluribus, PANOS, MikroTik, VyOS and cumulus) have not yet been migrated as we are trying to get the community more involved on those. We will prepare some documentation and prepare an announcement for those in the upcoming weeks.

As always, if you have any comment/concern or find any issues don't hesitate to let us know.
