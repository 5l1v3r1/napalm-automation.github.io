The way we configure and manage network devices have always differed depending on vendor and platform. While it can be a nice thought that we might sometime reach a point where this isn't the norm and vendor A allows their devices to be configured in the same way as vendor B.

In reality vendors want to differentiate themselves and often doesn't have any incentive to make it easier for their customers to work with the competitors products.

NAPALM is a Python library which aims to solve this by providing a unified API across network devices from various vendors.
